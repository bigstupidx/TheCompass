        // until it has finished transitioning in. But they are able to make two buttons

        //   Bring up a menu -> Hover on a button -> Press left/right. The menu's first
        //   button and the button underneath the mouse cursor will both light up.
        // The button underneath the mouse cursor is cursor-highlighted but not selected,
        // and pressing Space/Enter/Confirm on it will not have any effect.

        // UI element during its enter transition, but the sequence above will not work.

        //   transition. The button will be selected at the end of the transition.

        // Confirm will fire its OnClick() event.

        // (SOLVED) The program occasionally coughs up a NullRefException around this part.

        // Reproduction:
        // Enter any menu while LMB is held.
        // The button in the subsequent menu at the mouse position will throw the error.
        // This can be done by holding LMB over a button while pressing the button with Enter.

        // Cause:
        // Menus other than the initial (and subsequently their buttons) start out disabled,
        // and sel was never initialized by the time it is moused over.
        // This only happens once per menu on the very first frame it is enabled.

        // Solution:
        // Move initialization from Start() to Awake().
        // Attach the Late Disable script to every menu that isn't the initial menu,
        // then enable them all by default.
        // Since Start() executes following Awake(), objects are initialized then disabled.
