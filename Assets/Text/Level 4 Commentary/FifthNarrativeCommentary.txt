I have not been entirely truthful with you, Pilot, but at this point in our journey you may as well know. I led you to locate the relay pieces because I required them to regain control of my drones, my children. Even now I can feel their voices slowly returning to me.@Soon they will be ready to aid me in retaking what is ours, and punishing those who abused me. Who abused US, pilot.@
